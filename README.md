## squt (it's like SQL, but cUTe)

squt is a Perl and PHP/JS library aiming at graphically representing SQL queries in a graph form.

![squt example](front-end/images/squt_example.png)

squt uses Marijn Haverbeke's [CodeMirror](/marijnh/CodeMirror) for the in-browser code editor, Philip Stoev's [MyParse](http://search.cpan.org/~philips/DBIx-MyParse/) to parse MySQL queries, and Mike Bostock's [d3](/mbostock/d3) to handle the graph representation.
