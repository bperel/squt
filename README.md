## squt (it's like SQL, but cUTe)



squt is a Perl and PHP/JS Web application aiming at graphically representing MySQL queries in a graph form.

![squt example](https://raw.github.com/wiki/bperel/squt/images/squt_example.png)


## Installation

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name squt-box -p 8010:80 bperel/squt
```

squt will then be available through port 8010 of your machine : [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010)

#### Directly on a Debian/Ubuntu system or through Cygwin

If you prefer a step-by-step installation have a look at the [Installation guide](../../wiki/Installation-Guide).


## Features

Basically, squt works with most SELECT queries. It doesn't like nested subqueries that much though.

Head over to the [Features](../../wiki/Features) page for more details.

## Demo

[Check the website to test squt!](http://squt.ddns.net) :-)
