## squt (it's like SQL, but cUTe)

squt is a JavaScript and Perl library aiming at graphically representing SQL queries in a graph form.

?![squt example](https://raw.github.com/ducksmanager/squt/master/front-end/images/squt_example.png)

squt uses Philip Stoev's [MyParse](http://search.cpan.org/~philips/DBIx-MyParse/) to parse MySQL queries, and Mike Bostock's [d3](/mbostock/d3) to handle the graph representation.
